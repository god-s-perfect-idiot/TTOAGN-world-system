# TTOAGN-world-system
The world system design for The Tales of a Gutsy Ninja, a brand new and upcoming super ambitious 'certain manga/anime' inspired Unity 3D Project. 

<h4>Disclaimer:</h4>
I decided to test stuff in Python and later redo the whole logic in C# or try a cross-compiler onto my new PC whichever works better. So, yeah. there's that.
Ill keep you posted on how stuff works and stuff.

Goals:
- Day and Night System
- Aging system
- Character generation (True Random, hopefully)
- Voice filter for each character
- Character interactions
- Overlooking administration system
- Region balancing
- Random event spawning
- <h5>To Be Continued</h5>
